# LTCWD

This repo contains the data and analysis for the LTCWD project. We measured decomposition rates of coarse woody debris (CWD) in streams at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, spanning a natural gradient of inter-basin groundwater. We hypothesize decay rates are faster in streams with greater inter-basin inputs, as a result of higher phosphorus concentrations. CWD was deployed in litter bags in 5 streams and collected after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.  We supplemented decay rates with stream chemistry data from the STREAMS project long-term monthly sampling. 

This repository contains the data necessary to evaluate decay rates and stream chemsitry data from each month of data collection.
